//! Core transducer trait and composition.
//!
//! # Category Theory
//!
//! Transducers are natural transformations between fold functors. Given a reducing
//! function `R: (Acc, Out) -> Acc`, a transducer transforms it into a new reducing
//! function `(Acc, In) -> Acc`.
//!
//! Formally, a transducer `T: In ~> Out` is a polymorphic function:
//!
//! ```text
//! ∀Acc. ((Acc, Out) -> Acc) -> ((Acc, In) -> Acc)
//! ```
//!
//! Transducers form a category where:
//! - Objects are types
//! - Morphisms are transducers
//! - Composition is transducer composition
//! - Identity is the identity transducer
//!
//! The category laws hold:
//! - Left identity: `id().compose(t) == t`
//! - Right identity: `t.compose(id()) == t`
//! - Associativity: `(t1.compose(t2)).compose(t3) == t1.compose(t2.compose(t3))`
