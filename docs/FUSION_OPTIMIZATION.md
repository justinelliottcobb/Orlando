# Fusion Optimizations in Orlando

This document explains the fusion optimizations applied to Orlando's Pipeline implementation.

## What is Fusion?

**Fusion** (also called **deforestation** or **stream fusion**) is a compiler optimization technique that combines multiple operations into a single pass, eliminating intermediate data structures and reducing overhead.

### Traditional Multi-Pass Approach

```javascript
// Without fusion - processes each element 3 times
data.map(x => x * 2)        // Pass 1: iterate entire array
    .filter(x => x > 10)    // Pass 2: iterate entire array
    .slice(0, 5);           // Pass 3: copy first 5 elements

// For 100K elements:
// - 3 array iterations
// - 2 intermediate arrays allocated
// - 3 × 100K = 300K function calls
```

### Fused Single-Pass Approach

```javascript
// With fusion - processes each element once until done
const pipeline = new Pipeline()
  .map(x => x * 2)
  .filter(x => x > 10)
  .take(5);

pipeline.toArray(data);

// For 100K elements (with early termination):
// - 1 iteration (stops after finding 5)
// - 0 intermediate arrays
// - ~10-15 function calls (finds 5 matches quickly)
```

## Map→Filter Fusion Optimization

Orlando automatically detects and fuses common **Map→Filter** patterns.

### The Pattern

When you write:

```javascript
pipeline.map(x => x * 2).filter(x => x > 10)
```

Orlando internally transforms this into a single fused operation equivalent to:

```javascript
// Conceptually:
pipeline.mapFilter(x => {
  const mapped = x * 2;
  return mapped > 10 ? mapped : SKIP;
})
```

### How It Works

#### Step 1: Pattern Detection (in filter() method)

```rust
// src/pipeline.rs:99-106
if let Some(Operation::Map(map_fn)) = ops.pop() {
    ops.push(Operation::MapFilter {
        map: map_fn,
        filter: filter_fn,
    });
} else {
    ops.push(Operation::Filter(filter_fn));
}
```

When `.filter()` is called, it checks if the last operation was a `.map()`. If so, it pops the Map operation and pushes a fused MapFilter instead.

#### Step 2: Fused Execution (in process_value())

```rust
// src/pipeline.rs:282-287
Operation::MapFilter { map, filter } => {
    val = map(val);
    if !filter(&val) {
        return ProcessResult::Skip;
    }
}
```

The fused operation applies both transformations in sequence without intermediate branching.

### Performance Benefits

**Before Fusion (separate Map and Filter):**
```rust
// Pseudocode of what happens per element
match operation {
    Operation::Map(f) => {
        val = f(val);
        // Continue to next operation
    }
}
// ... check if more operations ...
match operation {
    Operation::Filter(pred) => {
        if !pred(&val) {
            return ProcessResult::Skip;
        }
    }
}
```

**After Fusion (MapFilter):**
```rust
// Pseudocode of what happens per element
match operation {
    Operation::MapFilter { map, filter } => {
        val = map(val);
        if !filter(&val) {
            return ProcessResult::Skip;
        }
    }
}
```

**Savings per element:**
- ✅ 1 fewer match arm
- ✅ 1 fewer branch check
- ✅ Better instruction cache locality
- ✅ More opportunities for CPU branch prediction

**For 100K elements:**
- 100K fewer match arms = ~100K fewer instructions
- Better cache utilization
- Estimated 5-15% performance improvement on Map→Filter chains

## Additional Benefits

### 1. Better Pipeline Cloning

The old implementation had a broken `clone_operations()` that returned an empty Vec. The new implementation:

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
enum Operation {
    Map(Rc<dyn Fn(JsValue) -> JsValue>),
    Filter(Rc<dyn Fn(&JsValue) -> bool>),
    MapFilter { map: Rc<...>, filter: Rc<...> },
    // ...
}
```

**Using `Rc` (Reference Counting):**
- Operations can be cloned without duplicating closures
- Pipelines can be reused and extended
- Memory efficient (shared ownership)

### 2. Reduced WASM Overhead

Every match arm in WASM has a cost:
- Branch prediction overhead
- Instruction fetch overhead
- Cache line pressure

Fusing operations reduces the number of match arms in the hot loop, making WASM execution more efficient.

## Automatic vs Manual Fusion

### Automatic Fusion ✅

Orlando automatically fuses these patterns:

```javascript
// Detected and fused automatically
.map(fn).filter(pred)
```

### Future Fusion Opportunities ⚠️

These patterns could benefit from fusion but are not yet implemented:

```javascript
// Map → Map fusion
.map(x => x * 2).map(x => x + 1)
// Could fuse to: .map(x => (x * 2) + 1)

// Filter → Filter fusion
.filter(x => x > 5).filter(x => x < 100)
// Could fuse to: .filter(x => x > 5 && x < 100)

// Map → Take fusion
.map(fn).take(n)
// Could short-circuit map evaluation after n elements
```

## Implementation Details

### Type Safety with Rc

Using `Rc<dyn Fn(...)>` instead of `Box<dyn Fn(...)>`:

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Enables `Clone` derive on `Operation` enum
- ✅ Allows pipeline composition and reuse
- ✅ Reference counting overhead is negligible (increments/decrements are cheap)

**Trade-offs:**
- ⚠️ Requires `Rc` for all closures (slight allocation overhead)
- ⚠️ Not `Send` (can't move across threads - but WASM is single-threaded anyway)

### Fusion Detection Strategy

The fusion optimization uses **greedy fusion** at construction time:

1. When `.filter()` is called, check the last operation
2. If it's a `.map()`, pop it and create fused `MapFilter`
3. If not, just add the `Filter` operation

**Why this works:**
- Most pipelines are built left-to-right (`.map().filter().take()`)
- Fusion happens immediately when the pattern is detected
- No need for a separate optimization pass
- Works with fluent API style

## Performance Measurements

### Theoretical Analysis

**For a pipeline:** `.map(x => x * 2).filter(x => x > 10).take(5)` on 100K elements

**Without Fusion:**
```
Operations per element:
1. Match on Map → execute map → continue
2. Match on Filter → execute filter → maybe skip
3. Match on Take → increment counter → maybe stop

Average: ~3 match arms + 2-3 function calls per element
Total: ~300K operations (until take stops)
```

**With Fusion:**
```
Operations per element:
1. Match on MapFilter → execute both → maybe skip
2. Match on Take → increment counter → maybe stop

Average: ~2 match arms + 2 function calls per element
Total: ~200K operations (until take stops)
33% reduction in match overhead!
```

### Expected Real-World Impact

Based on similar optimizations in other systems:

| Scenario | Expected Improvement |
|----------|---------------------|
| Simple .map().filter() | 5-10% faster |
| Complex pipeline (5+ ops with fusion) | 10-20% faster |
| Short-circuiting with .take() | 15-25% faster |
| Large datasets (1M+ elements) | 20-30% faster |

**Why the range?**
- JIT compilation effects vary
- WASM optimization levels differ across browsers
- CPU branch prediction varies by hardware
- Cache effects depend on data size

## Comparison with Other Libraries

### Lodash (No Fusion)

```javascript
// Lodash creates intermediate arrays
_.chain(data)
  .map(x => x * 2)
  .filter(x => x > 10)
  .take(5)
  .value();

// Each step allocates a new array
```

### Lazy.js (Lazy Evaluation, No Fusion)

```javascript
// Lazy.js delays execution but doesn't fuse
Lazy(data)
  .map(x => x * 2)
  .filter(x => x > 10)
  .take(5)
  .toArray();

// Still two separate operations per element
```

### Orlando (Fusion + Early Termination)

```javascript
// Orlando fuses AND terminates early
new Pipeline()
  .map(x => x * 2)
  .filter(x => x > 10)
  .take(5)
  .toArray(data);

// Single fused operation + stops at 5 elements
```

## Testing Fusion

To verify fusion is working:

```javascript
// This should create a MapFilter operation, not separate Map and Filter
const pipeline = new Pipeline()
  .map(x => x * 2)
  .filter(x => x > 10);

// Internally, pipeline.operations should contain:
// [MapFilter { map: ..., filter: ... }]
// NOT: [Map(...), Filter(...)]
```

Currently, there's no public API to inspect the internal operations list, but you can verify fusion by:

1. **Performance testing** - Fused pipelines should be 5-15% faster
2. **WASM inspection** - Check generated WASM for reduced instruction count
3. **Debugging** - Add console logging to pipeline execution

## Future Optimizations

### 1. Multi-Operation Fusion

Detect and fuse longer chains:

```javascript
.map(f1).map(f2).filter(p1).filter(p2)
// Could fuse to: .mapMapFilterFilter(f1, f2, p1, p2)
// Or: .map(x => f2(f1(x))).filter(x => p1(x) && p2(x))
```

### 2. Predicate Fusion

Combine filter predicates with logical AND:

```javascript
.filter(x => x > 5).filter(x => x < 100)
// Fuse to: .filter(x => x > 5 && x < 100)
```

### 3. Map Composition

Compose multiple maps into one:

```javascript
.map(x => x * 2).map(x => x + 1)
// Fuse to: .map(x => (x * 2) + 1)
```

### 4. Short-Circuit Map

When followed by Take, stop mapping after n elements:

```javascript
.map(expensiveFunction).take(5)
// Could optimize to only call expensiveFunction 5 times
```
